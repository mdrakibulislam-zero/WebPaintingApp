## What Have I Done:
I've made this painting app using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've used jscolor-2.0.5.js for made this project. I've also used the CDN of font-awesome 5.15.4 from CDNJS for use the icons.

jscolor.js is a self-sufficient JavaScript library consisting of only one file of plain JavaScript. It doesn't need any frameworks (jQuery, Dojo, MooTools, etc.) but it is friends with them all.

A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.

Font Awesome is a font and icon toolkit based on CSS and Less. As of 2020, Font Awesome was used by 38% of sites that use third-party font scripts, placing Font Awesome in second place after Google Fonts.
